# Introduction

## Cloud Native Handbook

Codeform seeks to enable teams who are building a DevOps/SRE practice while utilizing today's leading Cloud Native technologies. We do this by maintaining what we call the Cloud Native Handbook, a set of reference implementations and opinions on best practices. The reference implementations come from on-the-job implementations and the opinions are based on experience consulting with companies ranging from the smallest of startups to big names like Google.

## Projects

- [declare](https://github.com/codeformio/declare) - Extend Kubernetes APIs the easy way.

## Principles

The following principles guide our projects and opinions:

- Provide value first, optimize second.
- Heavily weight the simpler option.
- Show instead of tell.
