# Mentoring

We are currently actively mentoring individuals who want to start or grow their tech career. If any of the following sounds like you, we can help!

- I am new, where to start?
- I want to learn the Go programming language.
- What is a VM?
- Diving into dontainers / docker.
- What is kubernetes?
- What is a REST API? What is gRPC?
- Can you review my code? I would love a second opinion on my personal project.

The best way to get in touch is via social media:

- Twitter: https://twitter.com/nickstogner
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nstogner/
