# Cloud Native Handbook

The Cloud Native Handbook contains *opinionated* stances on Cloud Native concepts accompanied by exercises backed by a set of reference implementations. The reference code comes from on-the-job implementations and the opinions are based on experience consulting with companies ranging from the smallest of startups to large enterprises.

Topics covered:

- Repository organization (code and config)
- Development workflow (branching, building container images)
- Deploying code and configuration changes (branching, gitops)
- Teams (delegating resource management)
